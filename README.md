# Nano-Stream

A high-performance, low-latency C++ library for inter-process and inter-thread communication, inspired by **LMAX Disruptor** and **Aeron**.

## Features

- üöÄ **Lock-free Ring Buffer**: Ultra-fast single-producer, multiple-consumer ring buffer
- ‚ö° **Nanosecond Latency**: Optimized for high-frequency trading and real-time systems
- üßµ **Cache-Line Optimized**: Minimizes false sharing with proper memory alignment
- üîß **Modern C++20**: Uses latest C++ features for optimal performance
- üì¶ **Header-Only**: Easy integration with no linking required
- üìä **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: Extensive performance testing and comparison
- üß™ **Thoroughly Tested**: Full unit test coverage with Google Test

## Quick Start

### Building

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include "nano_stream.h"  // Single header include
using namespace nano_stream;

// Create a ring buffer for your events
struct TradeEvent {
    int64_t id;
    double price;
    int64_t quantity;
};

RingBuffer<TradeEvent> ring_buffer(1024, []() { return TradeEvent(); });

// Producer
int64_t sequence = ring_buffer.next();
TradeEvent& event = ring_buffer.get(sequence);
event.id = 123;
event.price = 100.50;
event.quantity = 1000;
ring_buffer.publish(sequence);

// Consumer
if (ring_buffer.is_available(sequence)) {
    const TradeEvent& event = ring_buffer.get(sequence);
    // Process event...
}
```

## Performance

Nano-Stream achieves:
- **Sub-nanosecond latency** for single-threaded operations
- **Millions of events per second** in producer-consumer scenarios
- **Zero memory allocation** during operation
- **Cache-friendly access patterns** for optimal CPU utilization

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Sequence**: Atomic sequence number with cache-line padding
2. **RingBuffer**: Lock-free circular buffer with pre-allocated entries
3. **EventFactory**: Interface for creating events

### Memory Layout

```
Cache Line 1: [Sequence Value + Padding]
Cache Line 2: [Ring Buffer Data + Padding]  
Cache Line 3: [More Ring Buffer Data...]
```
