# Nano-Stream Project Status Report

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Nano-Stream** is a high-performance, low-latency C++ communication library inspired by LMAX Disruptor and Aeron. The first phase focused on implementing the core lock-free ring buffer component.

## ✅ Completed Features (Phase 1)

### Core Implementation
- ✅ **Sequence Class**: Cache-line aligned atomic sequence with padding to prevent false sharing
- ✅ **RingBuffer Class**: Lock-free single-producer ring buffer with pre-allocated entries
- ✅ **Memory Optimization**: Hardware destructive interference size alignment
- ✅ **Modern C++20**: Leverages latest language features for optimal performance

### Key Capabilities
- ✅ **Lock-free Operations**: All operations are wait-free or lock-free
- ✅ **Zero Allocation**: No memory allocation during operation
- ✅ **Cache Optimization**: Minimizes false sharing and cache misses
- ✅ **Producer-Consumer**: Efficient single producer, single consumer patterns
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Support for claiming multiple sequences at once

### Testing & Validation
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite with Google Test
  - Sequence operation tests
  - Ring buffer functionality tests
  - Concurrent access tests
  - Memory alignment validation
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarks**: Extensive benchmarking with Google Benchmark
  - Single-threaded throughput
  - Producer-consumer latency
  - Comparison with std::queue
  - Memory access patterns
- ✅ **Example Code**: Working demonstration of library usage

### Documentation

- ✅ **README**: User-friendly introduction and quick start
- ✅ **Build Guide**: Detailed build instructions for all platforms
- ✅ **CMake Integration**: Professional build system with package support

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

Based on the implementation and design patterns:

### Expected Performance
- **Latency**: Sub-nanosecond for single-threaded operations
- **Throughput**: 50+ million events/second in producer-consumer scenarios
- **Memory**: Zero allocation during operation
- **CPU Cache**: Optimized for modern CPU cache hierarchies

### Memory Layout
```
[Cache Line 1] Sequence Value + Padding (64 bytes)
[Cache Line 2] Ring Buffer Fields + Padding 
[Cache Line 3+] Pre-allocated Event Array
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Sequence** (`sequence.hpp`)
   - Atomic int64_t with cache-line padding
   - Memory ordering optimizations
   - Compare-and-swap operations

2. **RingBuffer** (`ring_buffer.hpp`)
   - Template-based design for any event type
   - Power-of-2 sizing for fast modulo operations
   - Event factory pattern for pre-allocation

3. **EventFactory** (Interface)
   - Pluggable event creation
   - Lambda support for convenience

### Design Patterns
- **Single Writer Principle**: Eliminates write contention
