# Disruptor Design Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the design principles and implementation details of LMAX Disruptor, a high-performance inter-thread messaging library. The analysis covers event types, cross-language limitations, blocking/non-blocking interfaces, and producer type distinctions.

## Event Types and Zero-Copy Design

### Event Object Model
Disruptor uses a pre-allocated ring buffer where events are created once and reused. This approach:
- Eliminates garbage collection pressure
- Reduces memory allocation overhead
- Provides predictable memory access patterns
- Enables zero-copy event processing

### Event Factory Pattern
```java
public interface EventFactory<T> {
    T newInstance();
}
```

Events are created using factories and stored in the ring buffer. The same event objects are reused for all operations, with only their content being updated.

## Producer Type Distinction: Single vs Multi-Producer

### Why Distinguish Between Producer Types?

The distinction between single-producer and multi-producer scenarios is **fundamental to Disruptor's performance optimization**. The key difference lies in the `next()` method implementation:

#### Single Producer: Direct Assignment
```java
// SingleProducerSequencer.java
public long next(int n) {
    long nextValue = this.nextValue;
    long nextSequence = nextValue + n;
    long wrapPoint = nextSequence - bufferSize;
    long cachedGatingSequence = this.cachedValue;

    if (wrapPoint > cachedGatingSequence || cachedGatingSequence > nextValue) {
        cursor.set(nextValue);
        long minSequence;
        while (wrapPoint > (minSequence = Util.getMinimumSequence(gatingSequences, nextValue))) {
            LockSupport.parkNanos(1L);
        }
        this.cachedValue = minSequence;
    }
    this.nextValue = nextSequence; // Direct assignment - no atomic operation
    return nextSequence;
}
```

#### Multi Producer: Atomic Operation
```java
// MultiProducerSequencer.java
public long next(int n) {
    long current;
    long next;
    do {
        current = this.cursor.get();
        next = current + n;
        long wrapPoint = next - this.bufferSize;
        long cachedGatingSequence = this.cachedValue;

        if (wrapPoint > cachedGatingSequence || cachedGatingSequence > current) {
            long gatingSequence = Util.getMinimumSequence(this.gatingSequences, current);
            if (wrapPoint > gatingSequence) {
                LockSupport.parkNanos(1L);
                continue;
            }
            this.cachedValue = gatingSequence;
        } else if (this.cursor.compareAndSet(current, next)) {
            break;
        }
    } while (true);
    return next;
}
```

### Performance Impact

#### Single Producer Optimization
- **No atomic operations**: Uses direct assignment (`this.nextValue = nextSequence`)
- **No CAS loops**: Eliminates `compareAndSet` retry logic
- **Cache-friendly**: Predictable memory access patterns
- **Lower latency**: Sub-nanosecond sequence claiming
- **Higher throughput**: Reduced CPU cycles per operation

#### Multi Producer Safety
- **Atomic operations**: Uses `cursor.getAndAdd(n)` or `compareAndSet`
- **CAS loops**: Handles contention between multiple producers
- **Thread safety**: Ensures correct sequence allocation
- **Higher latency**: Additional synchronization overhead
- **Lower throughput**: More CPU cycles per operation

### Real-World Performance Difference

Based on benchmark results:
- **Single Producer**: ~400M ops/sec (optimized path)
- **Multi Producer**: ~300M ops/sec (atomic operations)
- **Performance gap**: ~25-30% difference in throughput

### When to Use Each Type

#### Single Producer (ProducerType.SINGLE)
- **Use cases**: Single-threaded producers, dedicated producer threads
- **Examples**: 
  - Market data feeds from single source
  - Logging systems with dedicated writer
  - Event sourcing with single command handler
- **Benefits**: Maximum performance, lowest latency

#### Multi Producer (ProducerType.MULTI)
- **Use cases**: Multiple concurrent producers, shared ring buffer
- **Examples**:
  - Multiple market data sources
  - Web servers with multiple request handlers
  - Microservices with multiple event sources
- **Benefits**: Thread safety, correct sequence allocation

### Implementation in nano-stream

Our C++ implementation follows the same principle:

```cpp
// Single producer - direct assignment
int64_t next_single_producer(int n) {
    int64_t next_value = next_value_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    int64_t next_sequence = next_value + n;
    // ... validation logic ...
    next_value_.store(next_sequence, std::memory_order_relaxed); // Direct assignment
    return next_sequence;
}

// Multi producer - atomic operation
int64_t next_multi_producer(int n) {
    int64_t current = next_value_.fetch_add(n, std::memory_order_acq_rel); // Atomic
    int64_t next_sequence = current + n;
    // ... validation logic ...
    return next_sequence;
}
```

## Cross-Language Limitations

### Why Disruptor Doesn't Support Cross-Language Communication

Disruptor is designed as a **same-language, in-process messaging library** and does not support cross-language communication for several fundamental reasons:

#### 1. **Memory Model Differences**
- **Java**: Managed memory with garbage collection
- **C++**: Manual memory management
- **Python**: Reference counting and garbage collection
- **Go**: Garbage collection with different memory layout

#### 2. **Object Serialization Overhead**
- Cross-language communication requires serialization/deserialization
- This defeats the purpose of zero-copy design
- Adds significant latency and CPU overhead
- Increases memory allocation pressure

#### 3. **Type System Incompatibilities**
- Different languages have different type representations
- Complex object graphs are difficult to serialize efficiently
- Type safety cannot be guaranteed across language boundaries

#### 4. **Performance Degradation**
- Serialization can add 10-100x latency overhead
- Memory copying eliminates zero-copy benefits
- GC pressure from temporary objects

### Cross-Language Architecture (External to Disruptor)

For cross-language communication, external middleware is required:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   nano-stream   │    │   Message       │    │   Disruptor     │
│   (C++)         │◄──►│   Middleware    │◄──►│   (Java)        │
│                 │    │   (Aeron/       │    │                 │

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Recommended Solutions:**
- **Aeron**: High-performance UDP messaging
- **ZeroMQ**: Cross-platform messaging library
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker with multiple protocol support

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking Interfaces

### Non-Blocking Interface: All-or-Nothing Model

Disruptor's non-blocking interface (`tryNext()`) follows an **all-or-nothing** approach rather than a best-effort model:

```java
public long tryNext(final int n) throws InsufficientCapacityException {
    if (n < 1) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be > 0");
    }
    
    long current;
    long next;
    
    do {
        current = this.cursor.get();
        next = current + n;
        
        if (!this.hasAvailableCapacity(n, current)) {
            throw InsufficientCapacityException.INSTANCE; // All-or-nothing
        }
    } while (!this.cursor.compareAndSet(current, next));
    
    return next;
}
```

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **No Partial Allocation**: Either gets all requested sequences or throws exception
2. **No Waiting**: Returns immediately if capacity is insufficient
3. **Exception-Based**: Uses `InsufficientCapacityException` for error handling
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Clear success/failure semantics

#### Why All-or-Nothing?
- **Atomicity**: Ensures event batches are processed atomically
- **Performance**: Avoids complex partial allocation logic
- **Simplicity**: Clear and predictable API behavior
- **Consistency**: Maintains event ordering guarantees

### Blocking Interface: Wait for Capacity

The blocking interface (`next()`) waits until sufficient capacity is available:

```java
public long next(final int n) {
    if (n < 1) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be > 0");
    }
    
    long current;
    long next;
    
    do {
        current = this.cursor.get();
        next = current + n;
        
        while (!this.hasAvailableCapacity(n, current)) {
            // Wait strategy determines how to wait
            waitStrategy.waitFor(next, cursor, current, this);
            current = this.cursor.get();
        }
    } while (!this.cursor.compareAndSet(current, next));
    
    return next;
}
```

                    │   (Kafka/Rabbit)│
                    └─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- **High Performance**: Zero-copy event processing within services
- **Low Latency**: Sub-microsecond event handling
- **Scalability**: Independent service scaling
- **Reliability**: Message broker provides persistence and delivery guarantees

## Best Practices

### 1. **Producer Type Selection**
- Use `SINGLE` producer when you have only one producer thread
- Use `MULTI` producer when multiple threads may produce events
- **Never** use `SINGLE` producer with multiple producer threads (undefined behavior)

### 2. **Wait Strategy Selection**
- **BusySpinWaitStrategy**: Lowest latency, highest CPU usage
- **YieldingWaitStrategy**: Balanced latency and CPU usage (default)
- **BlockingWaitStrategy**: Lowest CPU usage, highest latency
- **SleepingWaitStrategy**: Exponential backoff for CPU conservation

### 3. **Event Design**
- Keep events small and cache-friendly
- Avoid complex object graphs
- Use primitive types when possible
- Consider memory alignment for performance

### 4. **Buffer Size Selection**
- Must be power of 2 for efficient modulo operations
- Larger buffers = higher latency, more memory
- Smaller buffers = lower latency, less memory
- Balance between throughput and memory usage

### 5. **Language Boundaries**
- Use Disruptor/nano-stream for same-language communication
- Use external middleware (Aeron, ZeroMQ, Kafka) for cross-language communication
- Avoid serialization within performance-critical paths
- Consider protocol buffers or flatbuffers for cross-language data exchange

## Conclusion

Disruptor's design emphasizes **performance through simplicity**. The producer type distinction is a key optimization that provides significant performance benefits for single-producer scenarios while maintaining thread safety for multi-producer use cases. Understanding these design principles helps developers make informed decisions about when and how to use Disruptor effectively.

The library's focus on same-language, in-process communication is intentional and enables its exceptional performance characteristics. For cross-language scenarios, external messaging middleware provides the necessary functionality while maintaining Disruptor's performance benefits within language boundaries.
